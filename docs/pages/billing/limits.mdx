# Billing Limits

To help you avoid surprise bills, Insihts Workflows allows you to set a usage limit on your organization account. Setting a usage limit means we'll stop sending workflows to your users once the limit is reached. In other words, if you exceed the usage limit you set, no one will be able to see workflows until the next billing cycle.

## Setting a Usage Limit

To set a usage limit:

1. Go to your organization's settings.
2. Scroll to the **Usage Limit** section.
3. Set the number of workflows you want to allow per month and click **Save**.


## Precision

Because of the way Insihts Cloud and Workflows SDK work, we can't guarantee that we'll stop sending workflows exactly when the limit is reached. If you have a lot of users that you show workflows to, it's possible that we'll send a few more workflows than the limit you set.

This happens because the Workflows SDK loads all workflows the user can see at once and starts them when conditions are met. This means that if a user is initialized before the limit is reached, they'll still be able to see the workflows even if the limit has already been reached when starting the workflow. If you feel like you overshot the limit by too much, please contact us and we'll help you out.
