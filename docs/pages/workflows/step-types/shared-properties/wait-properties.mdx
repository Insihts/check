# Wait Properties

Wait properties can be customized in these step types:

- [Tooltip](/step-types/tooltip)
- [Modal](/step-types/modal)
- [Banner](/step-types/banner)
- [Wait](/step-types/wait)

The wait section allows you to pause the workflow until specific user interactions occur in the tooltip, modal, or banner before proceeding to the next step. To begin, add a wait option to the step by clicking the **Add Wait Option** button in the **Wait** section. You can add multiple wait options where each option can be completed independently.

## Different Types of Wait Options

There are currently five types of wait options. These are the same as the start options you can set for a workflow.

### Location

The **Location** option proceeds when the user visits a specific page. Only the location pathname is used for matching. For example, from the URL `https://acme.com/search=query=onboarding`, the `/search=query=onboarding` part is used.

When matching a location, the SDK uses regex. Entering `/onboarding` triggers a partial match. For exact matching, add the start `^` and end `$` symbols to the location, e.g., `^/onboarding$`.

Examples of possible locations:

- `empty` - Matches any URL (this will not continue the workflow on its own but can be combined with other options).
- `/` - Matches any URL (continues the workflow on every page if no other options are set).
- `^/$` - Matches the root page.
- `/onboarding` - Matches any URL with `/onboarding` in it.
- `^/onboarding` - Matches any URL starting with `/onboarding`.
- `^/onboarding$` - Matches exactly `/onboarding`.
- `search=.+` - Matches any URL with the `search` query parameter and at least one character value.

Location can be combined with other options to narrow down the wait conditions further.

### Click

The **Click** option continues a workflow when the user clicks on a specific element. Use a [CSS selector](#how-to-pick-the-right-css-selector) that matches the element.

### Element on Page

The **Element on Page** option continues a workflow when a specific element appears on the page/DOM. Use a [CSS selector](#how-to-pick-the-right-css-selector) that matches the element. This is useful to ensure the page is in a specific state before showing the workflow, such as when a page loads or when there is an empty state.

### Input Change

The **Input Change** option continues a workflow when the user changes the value of a specific input, like a text input in a form. Use a [CSS selector](#how-to-pick-the-right-css-selector) that matches the input element.

### Form Submit

Similarly to **Input Change**, the **Form Submit** option continues a workflow when the user submits a specific form. Use a [CSS selector](#how-to-pick-the-right-css-selector) that matches the form element.

## How to Pick the Right CSS Selector

Selecting elements on the page requires the right CSS selector to avoid conflicts with other elements. Here are some tips:

- **Use unique classes or IDs**: If possible, use unique classes or IDs for the target element to ensure the selector matches only the desired element.
- **Use the most specific selector possible**: If unique classes or IDs aren't available, use the most specific selector possible to reduce conflicts.
- **Use browser developer tools**: Use browser developer tools to find the right selector. This [guide](https://www.scrapingbee.com/tutorials/how-to-extract-css-selectors-using-chrome/) can help you find the right CSS selector.
- **Test the selector**: After selecting a selector, test it in the browser's console to ensure it matches the correct element. Use `document.querySelector` for testing.

Examples of CSS selectors:

- `#my-button` - Matches an element with the ID `my-button`.
- `.my-class` - Matches an element with the class `my-class`.
- `button` - Matches all button elements.
- `input[type="text"]` - Matches all text input elements.
- `body > div > div > form > div:nth-child(2) > button` - Matches a specific button element.
