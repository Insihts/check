# Preview Workflow

Test your workflow before making it live.


To preview a workflow before making it live, click the **Preview** button in the top-right corner of the workflow editor. This will open a modal where you need to enter the URL of the page where you want to test your workflow. After that, a new tab will open with the page you entered, and the workflow will start from there.

The preview will always show you the latest version of the workflow, regardless of whether it's published or in draft.

## Preview Panel



When the workflow is started in the preview, a panel will appear at the bottom of the screen. This panel will show you the current workflow with the option to reset or end the preview.

If the preview panel is hiding a part of the page you are testing, move it to the other side of the screen by clicking the arrow button in the right corner of the panel.

## Workflow Not Starting

1. Make sure the page you entered has Insihts Workflows installed with the correct Project ID.
2. Ensure the page domain is allowed in the Project settings.
3. Check the browser console on the preview page for any errors.
