# Migrate to Insihts Workflows

We understand that transitioning from your current solution to Insihts Workflows can be a daunting task. We're here to help you every step of the way.

## Assisted Migration

For a seamless transition, we will help you to migrate your existing onboarding solution to Insihts Workflows. Our team will work with you to understand your current setup and guide you through the migration process. We will help you to:

- Set up your Insihts Workflows account
- Recreate your existing onboarding in Insihts Workflows
- Style onboarding elements to match your brand
- Test the onboarding experience
- Train your team on how to use Insihts Workflows

This service is available to all customers who are looking to switch to Insihts Workflows free of charge. To request an assisted migration, [contact us](/contact-us).

## Transition Period

We understand that transitioning to a new tool can take time. To make the process easier, we offer a transition period where you can use Insihts Workflows alongside your current solution. This will give you time to set up Insihts Workflows, recreate your onboarding experiences, and test them before fully switching over.

To avoid double billing, any usage during the transition period (or until the end of your contract with your current provider) will be **free of charge**. To set up the transition period, [contact us](/contact-us).
