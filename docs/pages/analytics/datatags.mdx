# Tags in Insights

Use Insights tags to group events under a single website, gather data, and enable various functionalities.

<Steps>

### Use Cases

- **A/B Testing**: Test different versions of a webpage or campaign to see which performs better.
- **Event Grouping**: Group events to allow filtering and insights under a single website overview.

### Usage

To use tags, add the `data-tag` property to the tracking script. This will include the tag column in the payload.

Example:

```html filename="index.html"
<script
  defer
  src="https://collector.Prodio.com/script.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-tag="homepage-layout-a"
></script>
```

You can reuse the tracking script for different parts of your website, introducing additional tags:

```html filename="index.html"
<script
  defer
  src="https://collector.Prodio.com/script.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-tag="homepage-layout-b"
></script>
```

### Filtering

From the website **Overview**, you can filter on specific tags to focus on targeted data.
