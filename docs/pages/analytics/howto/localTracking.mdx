# Exclude Your Own Visits in Insights

If you want to visit your own website but exclude your visits from appearing in your stats, you can achieve this by adding a setting to your browser.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Open the Developer Console

Bring up the developer console in your browser:

- Go to **Settings** -> **More tools** -> **Developer tools**.

### Step 2: Exclude Yourself

In the console, enter the following code and press Enter:

```js
localStorage.setItem('insihts.disabled', 1);
```

This setting applies per website, so you will need to repeat this for each website you want to be excluded from.

### Step 3: Remove the Exclusion

To remove the setting and include yourself in the stats again, enter the following code and press Enter:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('insihts.disabled');
```

</Steps>
