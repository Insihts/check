Install the Prodio Workflows SDK library via an NPM package manager.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @Prodio/workflow
```

Create the Prodio Workflows component and initialize it with your project ID.

```jsx
"use client";

import { init } from "@Prodio/workflow";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const ProdioWorkflows = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    init({
      // Insert your Prodio Workflows projectId
      projectId: "xxxx",
    });
  }, []);

  return null;
};
```

Lastly, don't forget to render the Prodio Workflows component in the root of your application (`layout.tsx` or `App.tsx`). When that's done, you can start creating onboarding workflows and launching them in your product.

This is the simplest way to install Prodio Workflows. It only takes a few minutes.

Copy the snippet below and paste it within the `<head>` tag of your productâ€”ideally right before the closing `</head>` tag.

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@Prodio/workflow/latest/index.global.js"></script>
```

When you're done, you can start using Prodio Workflows by calling `Prodio.init()` anywhere in your code. You can find the `projectId` in your project settings.

```html
<script type="module">
  Prodio.init({
    // Insert your Prodio Workflows projectId
    projectId: "xxxx",
  });
</script>
```

Once the snippet is installed, you can start creating onboarding workflows and launching them in your product.

{/* ## Set up a proxy (optional) */}

{/* We recommend setting up a proxy to load workflows from Prodio Cloud, so they're less likely to be intercepted by ad blockers. There are several options for creating a reverse proxy, including Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify. */}

{/* TODO: Add a simple article for the proxy process */}
