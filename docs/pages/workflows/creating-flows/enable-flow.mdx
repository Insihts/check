# Enable Your Workflow

For your users to be able to see and interact with your workflow, you need to make it live. Making your workflow live will make the last published version of your workflow available to your users.

## Publishing Changes

Any changes you make to the workflow will be saved automatically as a draft version. These changes will not be visible to your users until you publish them. This allows you to make changes to your workflow and [preview them](/creating-flows/preview) before they are visible to your users. When you are ready to make your changes live, click **Publish Changes**.

 

## Making Your Workflow Live

After you have published your changes, you can make your workflow live by toggling the **Live** switch. When the switch is enabled, your workflow is live and available to your users.
