# Workflow frequency

Set how often the onboarding Workflow is shown to the user.


## Frequency options

- **Once** (default): The Workflow will be shown only once to the user. For this option to work, the user must be identified.
- **Every session**: The Workflow will be shown once per session when the user meets all Workflow conditions.
- **Every time**: The Workflow will be shown every time the user meets all Workflow conditions. We recommend using this option only for Workflows that are not intrusive
  and are not shown to the user too often.

## Reset user progress

When the Workflow is set to show only once, you can reset the progress for a selected user. This can be useful when you are testing the Workflow and want to see it again, or when you want to show the Workflow to the user again after some time.
