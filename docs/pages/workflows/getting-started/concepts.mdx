# Concepts

Get a basic understanding of Insihts Workflows so you can setup your projects and start using Insihts Workflows effectively.

## Basic Concepts

### Organization

An organization groups together all the projects and users in your company. It's the top-level entity in Insihts Workflows. Here you manage your billing, users, and projects. As a user, you can be a member of multiple organizations and can switch between these organizations using a dropdown in the top right-hand corner of the application. When you are logging into Insihts Workflows you are logging into your personal account.

### Project

An organization can have multiple projects. Projects typically represent a single application or a set of related applications. Each project has its own set of Insihts Workflows, analytics, and settings. Insihts Workflows are always installed on per Project basis and all users can (theoretically) see all Insihts Workflows in the project.

### Insihts Workflows

The most basic concept in Insihts Workflows is the flow. A flow is a sequence of steps that a user can take to complete a task. Insihts Workflows are created using the Insihts Workflows Cloud editor and can be started on a project's domain. Alternatively, you can define Insihts Workflows inside your codebase using the Insihts Workflows SDK.

### Flow Step

Flow steps are the building blocks of a flow. They are the individual steps a user can take when interacting with your flow. There are multiple types of flow steps, such as [Tooltip](/step-types/tooltip), [Modal](/step-types/modal),
[Banner](/step-types/banner), [Wait](/step-types/wait), and [Fork](/step-types/fork). Each flow step has its own set of properties and settings.
