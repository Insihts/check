# Wait Step

A wait step pauses the workflow and waits for a user to finish a specific action. You can wait for the user to click a button, navigate to a page, submit a form, etc.

In the demo below, after clicking **Continue** in the tooltip, the workflow waits for the user to click the **Click me to continue** button before proceeding to the next step.

## Configuration

The wait step has the same properties as the wait options in the tooltip and modal. You can configure it to wait for various user actions, such as:

- Clicking a button
- Navigating to a specific page
- Submitting a form
