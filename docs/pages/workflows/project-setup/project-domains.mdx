# Project Domains

Select the domains where the Prodio Workflows SDK can be used. This is a security feature that allows you to restrict where the Prodio Workflows SDK can be used.



## Add a Domain

To add a domain, just click on the **Add Domain** button and enter the domain name. Make sure to enter the domain with the correct protocol (`http://` or `https://`) and without the trailing slash. Wildcards are not supported.

### Null Origin

Some environments don't have a domain, for example, Figma plugins. You can allow null origins by adding `null` to the list of allowed domains.

## Local Development

When you are developing locally, you don't need to add `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` to the list of allowed domains. The Prodio Workflows SDK will work on your machine without any additional configuration. Note that any events from the local environment will be ignored in the analytics and billing.
